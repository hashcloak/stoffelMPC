## Demo Applications
- HoneyBadgerSwap: A basic Uniswap-liked automated market maker. We provide two version of this: one in which we want the identities of the traders to be known but not the amounts that they trade and another in which we want both the identities and amounts traded hidden. Similarly, for the liquidity providers.
- LMSR-based prediction market: Similar to the HoneyBadgerSwap example, except users bet on outcomes instead of trades that are determined by the logarithmic scoring rule by Hansen.
- An orderbook-based exchange: An exchange that uses an orderbook in order to keep track of buys and sell bids from traders and market makers.
- Auction: A basic double auction example based on the original Sugar Beet Auction
